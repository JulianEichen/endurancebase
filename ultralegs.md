Welcome to Ultra Legs! This strength routine has been developed over a few years for athletes we coach ranging from pros to beginners, combining elements of other programs into a quick set of exercises that can help the body excel at any distance, including ultramarathons. The main focus is on hamstring/glute strength and resilience! Your butt is going to be so ready for adventures.
>
> A few disclaimers: 
>- always work with a professional strength coach if possible. I am a running coach who tries to support athletes with strength work. Before you make comments, remember I AM BUT A SIMPLE COUNTRY RUNNING COACH
>- the form is not the best at times, especially on the single-leg deadlifts! My body is a wonderland, but this wonderland has a lot of trash lying around.
>- always listen to your body, your doctor, your pastor, your shaman, the voices inside your head, etc.
>
> How to use Ultra Legs:
> - do this routine 2-3 x per week, making sure you have an easy day of training afterward
> - you can add the Mountain Legs routine (   • Three-Minute Mountain Legs  ) on 2 other days
> - this routine differs from Speed Legs (   • 8-Minute Speed Legs  ) in that it has a heavier emphasis on hamstring and glute strength
> - as you get stronger, you can increase the weight using a heavy kettlebell or add another set of the exercises. But remember, the goal is to be good at running, not to get better and better at strength work until you’re split squatting a Honda Civic.
> - the goal is a routine that is as short as possible while being as effective as possible. If you’re going to add other exercises, consider squats and deadlifts, which may be especially beneficial for aging athletes and those with low bone density. Lift that Honda Civic to the moon!
> - when you start the routine, expect to get sore for a week or two. Dial back your running training intensity in that time, since your blood may be a toxic waste dump of creatine kinase.
> - After you complete the routine, ideally finish it off with a scoop of protein and some foam rolling, particularly on your hamstrings and glutes
>
>Typical week for athletes we coach: \
